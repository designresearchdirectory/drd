# Design Research Directory
Design Research Directory is an index of design researchers.

## About 
### Intention
We are developing an index of design research actors. This tool aims at making easier the identification of design researchers, their work ecosystem (including topics of interest) and their affiliations to different communities.
The strength of this visualisation tool will rely on the relevance of its content filters – it will allow different browsing experiences and it will enable meaning to arise from these datas.
In the end, this tool will allow you to fill a profile showing your positioning into the vast domain of design research, it will enable you to identify potential collaborators with a similar positioning, it will also help you to visualize your positioning in the overall context of the community. We hope it will encourage the birth of new interactions and collaborations and that it will facilitate a more global perception of the domain.
### Problem
We believe that people – design researchers and their work environment – are a relevant prism to understand more the rich and scattered domain that is design research. However it is hard to identify its actors.
On a larger scale, For fourty years the growing number of design researchers, coming from various disciplines, has not made easy the appreciation of these communities in different scales.
Existing tools allow to grasp an idea of the work or the professional background of an author but these informations are disconnected from the rest of the social network.
### Context
This project is initiated by a small team of benevolent, by researchers for researchers. It wish to find the best way to respond to a real need.
In order to make this project evolve together, we rely on your kind feedback and propositions. Our final vision of this project is ambitious, its crafting needs to evolve patiently by small iterations.

First step, we need a minimum of future members. [Don't hesitate to subscribe here](http://designresearchdirectory.org/).
