# Design Research Directory
Design Research Directory is an index of design researchers.

## About 
### Intention
We are developing an index of design research actors. This tool aims at making easier the identification of design researchers, the ecosystem in which they work (including topics of interest) and their affiliations to different communities.
More than an index, this visualisation will be structured around filters of navigation, their relevance will guarantee the strength of this tool – it will allow different browsing experiences and will enable meaning to arise from its user’s datas.
This tool will allow you to fill-up a profile showing your positioning into the vast domain of design research, it will enable you to identify potential collaborators with a similar positioning, it will also help you to visualize your positioning in the overall context of the community. We hope it will encourage the birth of new interactions and collaborations and that it will facilitate a more global perception of the domain.
### Problem
We believe that people – design researchers and their work environment – are a relevant prism to understand more the rich and scattered domain that is design research. However it is hard to identify its actors.
• On a larger scale, for fourty years the growing number of design researchers, coming from various disciplines, has not made easy the appreciation of these communities in different scales.
• Existing tools allow to grasp an idea of the work or the professional background of an author but these informations are disconnected from the rest of the social network.
### Context
This project is initiated by a small team of benevolent, by researchers for researchers. It wishes to find the best way to respond to a real need: your needs. For this we rely on your kind feedbacks and propositions. Our final vision of this project is ambitious however it will evolve by small iterations.

First step, we need a minimum of future members. [Don't hesitate to subscribe here](http://designresearchdirectory.org/).
